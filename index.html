   <h1> Strawberry Flavored Popcorn</h1> 
   <p> After homework, after dinner, after all the hectic hubbub in the evening, we all gather round and watch some of a movie together. It's a family routine.
     <p> It's secretly become my favourite part of the day; when my kids are in their PJs, and I've got my snack eating pants on, and we're all together, under blankets giggling away.</p>
   <p> One wrong move and Zen's got his fingers in your pits hollering "I am the tickle NINJA!" Look away for one split second, and Aedyn has raided your snack bowl. It's perfection.</p>
   <p><b> NO. 1 -> Use regular Jello! I have not tested this recipe with sugar-free Jello, so I can't vouch for the effectiveness.</b></p>

     <p> <b> NO.2 -> Don't overcook the sauce! It should be brought to a simmer and then stopped there.</b></p>
